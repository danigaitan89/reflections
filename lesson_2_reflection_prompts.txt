What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
It will create a .git directory in order to make ready to make some commits in the files on the repository I've created.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
It as intermidate area between them so you can organize your files pretty well before making a commit that makes sense.  It can save some mistakes for making them as a commit.  Commits cleaner!
